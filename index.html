      Professional Assessment

    <br>
      <p>
        As an intuitive, driven, passionate artist and developer with several years of freelance experience, SNHU’s Computer Science bachelor’s degree program has helped me gain confidence, determination, problem-solving skills, and a deeper understanding of computer science concepts. 
        As a professional, I value ethics, integrity, innovation, and positive contributions to society and my clients' lives. My goals are to work full-time using my skills as a software developer or digital/traditional artist in a meaningful, exciting, and rewarding career
        that supports my personal creative work and passions as a writer, artist, and musician not only financially but also in related skill, inspiration, and experience.
        <br><br>
        Throughout the degree, I practiced: (click on class names to see GitHub repos)<br><br>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Collaborating in a team environment</b> in courses such as <a href="https://github.com/VSnow1988/CS250_SNHU" target="_blank">CS-250: Software Development Life Cycle</a> in which I practiced working on a simulated corporate Agile team with other students and created professional reports for our project sprint.</li> 
          <li><b>Communication with stakeholders</b> in courses such as <a href="https://github.com/VSnow1988/CS255-SNHU" target="_blank">CS-255: System Analysis</a>, in which I created a Business Requirements Document and presentation after going through mock interviews and documents provided by a client to design a solution for them. In many other classes, ability to express ideas for a non-technical audience was stressed and required in my written assignments.</li> 
          <li><b>Data structures and algorithms</b> in courses such as <a href="https://github.com/VSnow1988/CS300-SNHU" target="_blank">CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms</a>, in which I studied common ways to structure data and their best applications, time complexity, commonly used algorithms for sorting and searching, and compared languages' implementations and terms.</li> 
          <li><b>Software engineering and database development</b> in courses such as <a href="https://github.com/VSnow1988/CS465-470-Fullstack" target="_blank">CS-465 and 470: Fullstack I and II</a>, in which I created a MEAN web application with a front, back, and database, and then adapted it to host live on the AWS cloud service.</li> 
          <li><b>Security</b> in courses such as <a href="https://github.com/VSnow1988/CS405-SNHU" target="_blank">CS-405: Secure Coding</a> and <a href="https://github.com/VSnow1988/CS305-SNHU" target="_blank">CS-305: Software Security</a> in which I learned about industry history and best practices, defense in depth, encryption, code security, common vulnerabilites and types of exploits.</li>  
        </ul>
        <br>
        In my remote degree, I have have worked with many languages, libraries and tools, managed my own time to meet deadlines, collaborated with people of varying communication styles and needs, and have had extensive practice in debugging, researching, and adapting to fast-changing technology independently.
        This e-portfolio and demo project demonstrates my skills in communication, design, continued learning, research, accessibility awareness, organization, flexibility, adaptiveness, algorithmic logic, problem-solving, debugging, and security.
