      <p>
        As an intuitive, driven, passionate artist and developer with several years of freelance experience, SNHU’s Computer Science bachelor’s degree program has helped me gain confidence, determination, problem-solving skills, and a deeper understanding of computer science concepts. 
        As a professional, I value ethics, integrity, innovation, and positive contributions to society and my clients' lives. My goals are to work full-time using my skills as a software developer or digital/traditional artist in a meaningful, exciting, and rewarding career
        that supports my personal creative work and passions as a writer, artist, and musician not only financially but also in related skill, inspiration, and experience.
        <br><br>
        Throughout the degree, I practiced collaborating in a team environment (examples), communication with stakeholders (examples), data structures and algorithms (as shown in <a href="https://github.com/VSnow1988/CS300-SNHU">CS300 Github repo</a>), software engineering and database development (examples), and security (as shown in <a href="https://github.com/VSnow1988/CS405-SNHU">CS-405 Github repo</a>). 
        <br><br>
        In my remote degree, I have have worked with many languages and tools, managed my own time to meet deadlines, collaborated with people of varying communication styles and needs, and had extensive practice in debugging, researching, and adapting to fast-changing technology independently.
        This e-portfolio and demo project demonstrates my skills in communication, design, continued learning, research, accessibility awareness, organization, flexibility, adaptiveness, algorithmic logic, problem-solving, debugging, and a security mindset.
