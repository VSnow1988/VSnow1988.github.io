            <p> 
                The original 'My Inventory' app was created in CS360: Mobile Architecture and Development in 2023 as a simple Android application, written in Java and built on Android Studio Flamingo. This was my first experience with mobile development, and it fulfilled the project requirements with a functional layout, login screen, a main view that displays data from a local SQLite database, and CRUD functions for items in the database. In CS499 Computer Science Capstone, it was enhanced in three steps over the course of the CS 499 Computer Science Capstone. Each step covers a different area of development: Software Design and Development, Algorithms and Data Structues, and Databases. I chose this project because it was something I had no prior experience in, something I enjoyed learning and working on, and mobile application development is a fast-growing field that could soon replace web applications as a primary need for businesses and way to interact with users and customers. More people use smartphones daily than PCs and roughly 70% of adults believe apps on their 'pocket computers' will make websites obsolete in 10 years (SWNS 2023.) Mobile gaming is also a growing and lucrative field, accounting for around 45% of worldwide video game industry revenue in 2022 (Statista.)
                <br><br>
                This application was first enhanced with a UX re-design using a variety of tools including Figma and Canva for documents such as user personas and use-cases considered for the application's features. I designed an entirely new layout that aligned better with accessibility standards for the wide target audience. The code was re-written almost from the ground up, with better comment documentation and code organization as well as adherence to standards and naming conventions. The new layout was made responsive for all normal-range screen sizes with the Constraint Layout, and the item list was changed to a Recycler View in line with best practices for efficiency. Font sizes were enlarged, elements were spaced further, all buttons and elements were given alt text for screen readers, and the color contrast was checked for recommended difference. All strings and values were placed in xml files so that they could be re-used and translated. Appropriate resources were used for the colors and icons, filenames were also changed, the app was given a name and the package was given an appropriate name.
                <br><br>
                The second enhancement improved the code's organization and security. Errors were fixed and logic improved so that the Recycler View populated with data properly, and then the logic was added for the update and delete item functions. The lookup algorithms use SQL commands to get a unique index, which is an optimal O(1) time complexity. The string comparisons are at most O(n). Layers of input validations were added and optimized, open conditionals were closed, and Javadocs were added for custom functions to improve the experience for other developers working with the code. The show/hide password toggle was added using a newer built-in feature in the Java Android library as the most efficient implementation. The 'show zero stock items' feature was added with a Boolean toggle in the Recycler Adapter, and a note was added about the bug upon testing. Logging and error handling was added, as was a complete TODO/FIXME tasklist within the code.
                <br><br>
                The third enhancement objective was to implement a remote database, a solution for the use cases in which the user would like to share access to the same inventory with an associate or household member and use the app without wi-fi. Google Firebase services were chosen for their security features, user support, intuitiveness, and good documentation as well as ease of functionality with mobile applications. A service also exists in the Firebase toolbox for offline usage and periodic syncing. The design documents outline the plan for the final product. I set up a Firestore database, created the NoSQL version of the tables for testing, connected it to the application, and then wrote and tested code for the Login view. In the third version of the app, anything to do with the Users table is handled by the remote database while the items are still handled by local SQLite. Code documentation was improved, bugs were fixed and a complete TODO task list with numbered steps was added to complete this upgrade to the app.
                <br><br>
                This current version of the application meets standards for accessibility and user needs with secure, standard-adherent, efficient code and professional documentation for collaboration. 
                <br><br>
                The skills it best exemplifies are a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits, and the ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques and tools to deliver value and achieve industry-specific goals. The new code prevents overflow, code injections and program crashes with layered input validations, error handling, and logging to help solve problems that arise and addresses potential issues to consider before release in the FIXME notes. It uses a secure database provider with verifications and validations server-side and many tools available to increase defense in depth. Many tools were used and considered in this process both designing and developing. Upgrades were made to adhere with current standards, and documentation was consulted to solve errors and create an efficient solution. Especially alongside my other work, it shows comfort and confidence in problem-solving and working with new concepts, programs, and languages. If you wish to read the full narratives of the process, 
                you can find them in the github repo in the 'narratives' folder.

                This example of an informal code review explains and inspects two SNHU projects, and outlines the original plan made
                for the three enhancement milestones in the computer science capstone class. Though this plan was changed, this video 
                demonstrates competency and awareness of security concepts, coding standards, best practices, algorithmic logic, 
                and collaborative communication.

            I made these personas with Canva, use-case diagram with Venngage, and initial wireframes with Figma. These helped plan
            solutions for the users' needs in the form of an upgraded inventory-tracking mobile application and guide the first UX 
            enhancement as well as the rest of this project's functionality and design choices. They demonstrate familiarity with
            design principles and tools as well as the planning process in software development.
