            <h4>Code Review: 'My Inventory' Android App and 'Brick Breaker' Game with OpenGL & C++</h4>

            <p>
                This example of an informal code review explains and inspects two SNHU projects and outlines the orignal plan made
                for the three enhancement milestones in the computer science capstone class. These were changed later on, though this video 
                still highlights the changes being made and demonstrates competency and awareness of security concepts, coding standards,
                best practices, algorithmic logic, and collaborative communication.
            </p>

                This project, originally made earlier in my degree in CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Development,
                was enhanced in three steps over the course of the CS 499 Computer Science Capstone. Each step covers a different
                area of development: Software Design and Development, Algorithms and Data Structues, and Databases.
                The github repo link at the bottom of the page will open in a new window and contains zipped folders for every 
                stage of the process as well as full narratives.
